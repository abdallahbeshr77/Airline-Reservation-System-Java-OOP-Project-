# ✈️ Airline Reservation System (Java OOP Project)

This is a console-based Airline Reservation System developed using Java. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles including inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## 🚀 Features

- Add Domestic and International Flights
- Book Seats for Passengers
- Cancel Reservations
- View All Available Flights
- View Passenger's Booked Flights
- Input validation and exception handling

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Classes & Objects**
- **Inheritance**
- **Encapsulation**
- **ArrayLists**
- **Exception Handling**
- **Enhanced For-Loops**
- **Method Overriding**

## 📁 Project Structure
```
airlinemanagement/
├── AirlineReservationSystem.java     // Main class
├── DomesticFlight.java               // Subclass of Flight
├── InternationalFlight.java          // Subclass of Flight
├── Flight.java                       // Base Flight class
├── FlightManager.java                // Manages flights & bookings
├── Person.java                       // Base class for Passenger & Manager
├── Passenger.java                    // Handles passenger data
```

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.java` files.
2. Compile all files:
```
javac airlinemanagement/*.java
```
3. Run the system:
```
java airlinemanagement.AirlineReservationSystem
```

## 📸 Sample Console Output
